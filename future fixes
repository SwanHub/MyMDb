Bugs We Found Today

  - If a User doesn't have any previous comparisons, the comparison path breaks.
        [x]Create an if/else statement in the Comparison / Users Controller to account for new users.

  - The styling of "Movie Information" is terrible.
        Create an event listener on those sections for a user to hide or display that data.

  - We don't need a specific "Add to Favorites" page anymore. Current_user takes care of that.
        Remove "Add Favorites" Route
        Include "Add Favorites" button in "Search Movies" path.
        [x]Use "Current_user" instead of the foisted "@user" instance...
        [x]Change "No Repeat favorites." To something more fun.

  - Give Credit to OMDb at the base of the page.
        [x]Make sure height of page is always at least the size of the window.
        [x]Make sure height of page is dynamic.
        [x]Include at the base of the page in <small> footer tag, "Data seeded via [OMDb.com]"

  - Make the comparisons buttons instead of the "left and right" radio buttons.
        [x]Remove extraneous dropdown info
        [x]Make the dropdown a clickable button that posts to comparisons
