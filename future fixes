Fixes

      - The styling of "Movie Information" is terrible.
            Create an event listener on those sections for a user to hide or display that data.

      - We don't need a specific "Add to Favorites" page anymore. Current_user takes care of that.
            Remove "Add Favorites" Route
            Include "Add Favorites" button in "Search Movies" path.

      - Recommendation Function is weak.
            Restrict to just english words...
            Make sure that no recommendations are also "favorites"
            Make sure you can't get recommendations if you haven't added to favorites yet.
