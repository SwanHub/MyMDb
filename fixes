Bugs We Found Today

  - If a User doesn't have any previous comparisons, the comparison path breaks.
        Create an if/else statement in the Comparison / Users Controller to account for new users.

  - The styling of "Movie Information" is terrible.
        Create an event listener on those sections for a user to hide or display that data.
  - We don't need a specific "Add to Favorites" page anymore. Current_user takes care of that.
        Remove "Add Favorites" Route
        Include "Add Favorites" button in "Search Movies" path.
        Use "Current_user" instead of the foisted "@user" instance...
        Change "No Repeat favorites." To something more fun.
  - Give Credit to OMDb at the base of the page.
        Make sure height of page is always at least the size of the window.
        Make sure height of page is dynamic.
        Include at the base of the page in <small> footer tag, "Data seeded via [OMDb.com]"
  - Make the comparisons buttons instead of the "left and right" radio buttons.
